## Metrology System Design
Designed and implemented a metrology system that is capable of planning and executing measurements 33\% faster than the original method, processing results, and generating reports for a workpiece that is 2m in range. The system integrates a structure light camera, an industrial robot, and two PCs via Ethernet.
## Serial Robot Calibration
Designed and implemented a kinematics parameters self-calibrate algorithm with the product of exponential (POE) formula that enables the system to carry out measurement at an accuracy of 0.3 mm
