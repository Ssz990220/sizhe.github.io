Sizhe Sui is a first-year Ph.D. student in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin, where he is fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Luis Sentis](https://www.ae.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/sentis). He received his Bachelor's degree from SJTU and graduated from the Hsue-shen Tsien Honored Program. During his Master's studies, he focused on robotics algorithm design under the guidance of [Prof. Ye Ding](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jr4Ph0QAAAAJ&hl=en). He also had the opportunity to work in the [PAIR lab](https://www.pair.toronto.edu/) with [Prof. Animesh Garg](https://animesh.garg.tech/) from May to October 2020.

Sizhe's research interests revolve around (multi) robot kinematics calibration, motion planning, and robotic vision. He's particularly passionate about leveraging the power of massive-parallel computation units (such as GPUs) to accelerate robotics algorithms. He's excited to explore new possibilities by designing algorithms with parallelism in mind from the outset.

He has an in-depth understanding of <b>robot kinematic parameter calibration, multi-robot system calibration, time optimal trajectory planning, sample-based motion planning and point cloud registration</b> thanks to his participation and dedication in [previous projects](https://ssz990220.github.io/projects/). He also has rich experience with hardware robotics platforms by building experiment environments from scratch with ROS.

In his leisure time, he is a breath-stroke swimmer and a photographer (part-time Photojournalism). Some of his works are exhibited in [Portfolios](https://ssz990220.github.io/portfolio/).
