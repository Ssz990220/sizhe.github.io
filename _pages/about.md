Sizhe Sui is currently pursuing his Master’s degree in Robotics at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). He received his Bachelors’s degree from SJTU and graduated from the Hsue-shen Tsien Honored Program. He is now supervised by [Prof. Ye Ding](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ye-Ding-10) and is fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Animesh Garg](https://animesh.garg.tech/) as a summer intern in 2020.

His research interests involve (multi) robot kinematics calibration, motion planning and robotic vision. He is also fascinated with accelerating robotics algorithms with massive-parallel computation units (like GPU). He is eager to explore the possibilities of redesigning algorithms with parallelism considered from its initial build. Currently, he is carrying out an intern research with [Prof. Luis Sentis](https://www.ae.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/sentis) and [Dr. Andrew Bylard](https://stanfordasl.github.io//people/andrew-bylard/) on such a topic.

He has an in-depth understanding of robot kinematic parameter calibration, multi-robot system calibration, time optimal trajectory planning, sample-based motion planning and point cloud registration thanks to his participation and dedication in [previous projects](https://ssz990220.github.io/project/). He also has rich experience with hardware robotics platforms by building experiment environments from scratch with ROS.

In his leisure time, he is a breath-stroke swimmer and a photographer (part-time Photojournalism). Some of his works are exhibited in [Portfolios](https://ssz990220.github.io/portfolio/).
