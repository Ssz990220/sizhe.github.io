Sizhe Sui is currently pursuing his Master’s degree in Robotics at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). He received his Bachelors’s degree from SJTU and graduated from the Hsue-shen Tsien Honored Program (Top 5%). He is now supervised by [Prof. Ye Ding](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ye-Ding-10) and was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Animesh Garg](https://animesh.garg.tech/) as a summer intern in 2020.

His research interests involve (multi) robot kinematics calibration, motion planning and robotic vision. He is also fascinated with <b>accelerating robotics algorithms with massive-parallel computation units</b> (like GPU). He is eager to explore the possibilities of redesigning algorithms with parallelism considered from its initial build. Currently, he is carrying out a summer research with [Prof. Luis Sentis](https://www.ae.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/sentis) and [Dr. Andrew Bylard](https://stanfordasl.github.io//people/andrew-bylard/) on such a topic.

He has an in-depth understanding of <b>robot kinematic parameter calibration, multi-robot system calibration, time optimal trajectory planning, sample-based motion planning and point cloud registration</b> thanks to his participation and dedication in [previous projects](https://ssz990220.github.io/projects/). He also has rich experience with hardware robotics platforms by building experiment environments from scratch with ROS.

In his leisure time, he is a breath-stroke swimmer and a photographer (part-time Photojournalism). Some of his works are exhibited in [Portfolios](https://ssz990220.github.io/portfolio/).
